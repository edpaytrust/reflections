How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Removed all of the noise (things that are the same), so could folcus only 
    on what changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   See what changed along the way, and able to revert to earlier things that 
   worked 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro is you do not automaticaly overwrite prior save points, 
    Con you can lose work when system blows up

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is based on programming where multiple files need to work in concernt,
    Docs assumes you are workign on one file at a time and each is atomic

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the history of all changes ant the associated ID. 
    Git diff enables you to comapre any two change id and see what is different 
    between them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always go back to a safe place

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Managing the code for my various experiments
